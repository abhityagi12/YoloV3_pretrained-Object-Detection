# YoloV3_pretrained-Object-Detection

In this model, pretrained weights of yolov3 are used (model not trained) to detect objects in image and at real time(using webcam).

Implementation:

1. Download this repo. Download yolov3 weights from "https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/" and add to the folder "model_data".

2. go to the root directory where image_detect.py and webcam_detect.py are located.

run image_detect.py for detecting in image (add path to image in main function).
run webcam_detect.py for real time detecion.
